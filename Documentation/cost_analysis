JupyterHub cluster cost depends on 

* Number of users = number of EC2 instances in the cluster (or cluster size)
* Instances type,  
* Storage (EBS) per instance
* snapshot rate of the storage
* Cluster manager size
* Users average usage (hours per month)

To calculate the cost let devide the cost dependancies into variables in a calculation formula

  M : Manager EC2 cost per month
  N : Number of user = number of instance
  A : Average hours usage per user per month
  T : users instance type
  SS: EBS storage size
  SC: EBS storage cost per GB per month
  PC: EBS snapshot cost per GB per month

Monthly cost  = Manager  + Users computation + Users storage
Monthly cost  = M             + (N  * T * A )             + (N * SS * (SC + PC)))


Example: 
jupyterhub cluster with 20 users, each of which provisioned with t2.medium (4G Memory and 2vCPU) and 3G EBS, and assume the average hour per month per student is 30,  
Then the monthly cost will be around:  
Monthly cost  = M +  N  * (T     * A  + SS * (SC   + PC  ) )
              = 34 + 20 * (0.047 * 30 + 3  * (0.05 + 0.05) ) =  34 + 29.5 =~ $68

Special cases: 
If the 20 users never use the system then A (Average hours usage per user per month) would be Zero, then the monthly cost will 
be the cost of the manager = $34
If the 20 users abuse the system by running their notebooks 24 * 7 then A will be 720 and the total cost will be:
34 + 20 * (0.047 * 720 + 3  * (0.05 + 0.05) ) = $717
